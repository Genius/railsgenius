%h1 Hey!

%p
  Rails Geniusâ„¢ is an example application that I (Andrew Warner) built for RailsConf 2014, to demonstrate "Perspectives",
  a new way of building rich client applications with Rails. Head over to
  = link_to 'my talk', talk_path(Talk.find_by_id(1)), :'data-no-perspectives' => true, target: '_blank'
  to check out a good example of an annotated talk on Rails Genius. For more information about building apps using Perspectives,
  check out
