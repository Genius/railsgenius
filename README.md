Rails Geniusâ„¢ is an example application that I (Andrew Warner) built for RailsConf 2014, to demonstrate "Perspectives", a new way of building rich client applications with Rails. For more information about building apps using Perspectives, check out [the github page](https://github.com/RapGenius/perspectives)
